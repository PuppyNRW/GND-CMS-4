            text: "The Gear and Fetish Party Gear'n'Dance (friends call it GND) is organized by the association „Puppy and Friends NRW e.V.“, an association for the puppy play and fetish community in NRW. Inspired by the pup play sauna event „Chill&Bark“ in the Metropol Sauna in Essen, the idea was born to bring together fetishes of all kinds - way beyond puppy play. As a framework, a party character with a great community spirit was developed, which is diverse and also open for specials. Fetish can be more than just sex with special or particular preferences. So the focus at GND is not on having fun in a sling, but on celebrating fetish life. Especially the non-sexual, social part of the puppy community and the fetish lifestyle is lived and celebrated together at the Gear'n'Dance Party. Going out, socializing and partying in fetish gear is otherwise often only possible in special clubs belonging to the community or on occasions like a pride. Because not every bar or party in the Ruhr area and NRW regularly allows wearing fetish outfits. Regardless of gender, sexuality and identity, the Gear'n'Dance Party wants to be a melting pot of fetish life.",
